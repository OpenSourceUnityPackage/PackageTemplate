# Package template

To create new project, just copy this repository and replace all TODO (use global find with your IDE and search "TODO" key word. Don't forget to rename files).
This architecture is based on unity package layout presented [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html)
Sample folder contain character '~' that mean that this folder will be ignored by unity.
All sample must be referenced in package.json and can be imported independently in package manager window.
So, don't hesitate to create sample to create more modular package for user. 
Please don't change the license, and don't forget to update your changelog file and package version in package.json.
For clear information about your package, write some demonstration and information in readme.
Please test to import your package for each stable version.
